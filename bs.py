#0.5 - changed the way place_ship appends shit to the board list.
#    - built test_ship_gen for testing the for/while loop for building ships
#    - added counter to while loop (20) to keep track of runaway loops until we have better checks on input.

#0.6 - changed check guess legal to work with dict structure
#    - added hits key in ships dict
#    - added store hit and store miss

#0.7 - added guess function, works well so far.
#    - Changed check_guess_hit, as it was pointlessly making things complicated.
#    - Added turns to the board dict so I can track the number of turns the user has had. Missing increments this.

#0.8 - pulled together the guess function into a while loop with exit conditions
#    - Lost track.
#    - Changed guess function so no more errors if guess out of scope.
#    - added OS clear, so no more buildup of boards
#    - changed get_guess so it would catch value errors and ask again for input.
#    - changed a few raw_input calls so it would figure out how long the board is.
#    - added get_int_input function for returning an int value when you pass it a string.
#    - changed test_ship _gen to use the above
#    - changed get_ship_info to do the same
#    - fixed a bug where you could break rand function by entering a ship larger than board.
#    - removed redundant board placement function
#    - changed gen_board and board_dict to just take the param dict.
